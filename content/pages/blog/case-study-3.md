    Background:
    Parikh Health, a medical practice led by Dr. Neesheet Parikh, faced challenges with administrative overhead and patient engagement. Staff spent significant time on manual check-ins and managing patient charts, which impacted care quality and efficiency.

    AI Solution:
    They implemented Sully.ai, an AI-driven platform integrated with their Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). The system automates front-desk tasks and personalizes patient interactions during check-in.
